#  Banking & Financial Services

**Asset and Wealth Management**

Wealth management is a high-level professional service that combines financial and investment advice, accounting and tax services, retirement planning, and legal or estate planning for one set fee. Clients work with a single wealth manager who coordinates input from financial experts and can include coordinating advice from the client's own attorney, accountants and insurance agent. Some wealth managers also provide banking services or advice on philanthropic activities.

**Retail Banking**

Retail banking addresses the banking and financial services needs of individuals also called Consumers and small medium enterprises (SME) or Small Businesses with say less than 1 M USD in revenue, otherwise called retail customers. Retail transactions are typically large volume low value but strongly governed by consumer friendly regulations and are critical to a bank. Retail banks or stores offer various services such as - Deposits (savings and checking accounts), Loans (mortgages, personal), debit cards, credit cards, investment products and so on. This is a typical mass-market banking in which individual customers use local branches, ATMs, Online banking, Phone Banking, Contact Centers and recently mobile banking for their financial / banking needs. In some geography such as Europe, APAC, Middle East retail banks also offer investment services such as wealth management, brokerage accounts, private banking and retirement planning for High Net-worth Individuals.

**Mortgage & Consumer Landing**

A mortgage represents transfer of interest on a property/house to a lender as a security of debt which is usually a loan taken for buying a house. This loan has to be paid over a specified period of time. Think of it as customer personal guarantee that he will repay the money he has borrowed to buy his home. Strangely enough, the word "mortgage" comes from the French word "mort," which means "dead," and "gage," from Old English which means "pledge". Nowadays, the term mortgage is commonly used to refer to a loan for the purpose of purchasing a property. We don't associate anyone's death with it! Most mortgage loans are negotiated for a set time period and Interest rate. Interest rate could be fixed for the entire loan term or floating or Hybrid (Fixed for certain period). Generally, customer can pay off a loan in full or in part at any time, although bank may charge a penalty depending upon the terms and conditions.

  

## BFS CONCEPTS

## Money

Money is a standardized unit of exchange”. The practical form of money is currency. It varies across countries whereas money remains the same. For example, in India, the currency is the Indian Rupee (INR) and in the US, it is the US Dollar (USD).

Due to various economic factors, the value of each country’s currency is not equal. For example, if the exchange rate between US Dollars (USD) and Indian Rupees (INR) is USD 1 = INR 46.70, it implies that one U.S dollar is equivalent to 46.70 Indian Rupees. The USD is normally taken as a benchmark against which to compare the value of each currency.

## Interest: Simple and Compound

Interest is the amount earned on money; there is such an earning because present consumption of the lender is being sacrificed for the future; it is letting somebody else use the money for present consumption. Using an analogy, interest is the ‘rent’ charged for delaying present consumption of money. Interest rates are not constant and will vary depending on different economic factors

**Simple interest**

Simple interest is calculated only on the beginning principal. Simple Interest = P*r*t/100 where: P is the Principal or the initial amount borrowed or deposited, to earn or charge interest on, r is the interest rate and t is the time period.

**Compound interest**

With compound interest, interest is calculated not only on the beginning interest, but on any interest accumulated with the initial principal in the meantime. Compound interest = [P*(1+r/100)^t – P], where: P is the Principal or the initial amount initially borrowed or deposited, to earn or charge interest on, r is the interest rate and t is the time period.

## Inflation

Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation — and avoid deflation — in order to keep the economy running smoothly.

A quantitative estimate of inflation in a particular economy can be calculated by measuring the ratio of Consumer Price Indices or CPI of two consecutive years. That’s right, the CPI that one hear of, is the weighted average price, of a predefined basket of basic goods. The % increase of the CPI this year vs. the CPI of last year, gives the inflation, or rise in price of consumer goods, over last year.

Inflation results in a decrease in the value of money over time. The link between the interest rates, nominal and real, and inflation enables one to identify this impact.

## Financial Instruments

**Raising Capital**

Corporations need capital to finance business operations. They raise money by issuing Securities in the form of  Equity  and  Debt . Equity represents ownership of the company and takes the form of stock. Debt is funded by issuing  Bonds, Debentures  and various certificates. The use of debt is also referred to as  Leverage Financing.  The ratio of debt/equity shows a potential investor the extent of a company’s leverage.

Investors choose between debt and equity securities based on their investment objectives. Income is the main objective for a debt investor. This income is paid in the form of  Interest , usually as semi-annual payments.  Capital Appreciation  (the increase in the value of a security over time) is only a secondary consideration for debt investors. Conversely, equity investors are primarily seeking  Growth , or capital appreciation. Income is usually of lesser importance, and is received in the form of  Dividends .

Debt is considered senior to equity (i.e.) the interest on debt is paid before dividends on stock. It also means that if the company ceases to do business and liquidate its assets, that the debt holders have a senior claim to those assets.

**Security**

Security is a financial instrument that signifies ownership in a company (a stock), a creditor relationship with a corporation or government agency (a bond), or rights to ownership (an option**).**

Financial instruments can be classified into:

Debt

Equity

Hybrids

Derivatives

**Debt**

Debt is money owed by one person or firm to another. Bonds, loans, and commercial paper are all examples of debt.

**Bond**

An investor loans money to an entity (company or government) that needs funds for a specified period of time at a specified interest rate. In exchange for the money, the entity will issue a certificate, or bond, that states the interest rate (coupon rate) to be paid and repayment date (maturity date). Interest on bonds is usually paid every six months (semiannually).

Bonds are issued in three basic physical forms: Bearer Bonds, Registered As to Principal Only and Fully Registered Bonds.

Bearer bonds are like cash since the bearer of the bond is presumed to be the owner. These bonds are  Unregistered  because the owner’s name does not appear on the bond, and there is no record of who is entitled to receive the interest payments. Attached to the bond are  Coupons . The bearer clips the coupons every six months and presents these coupons to the paying agent to receive their interest. Then, at the bond’s  Maturity , the bearer presents the bond with the last coupon attached to the paying agent, and receives their principal and last interest payment.

Bonds that are registered as to principal only have the owner’s name on the bond certificate, but since the interest is not registered these bonds still have coupons attached.

Bonds that are issued today are most likely to be issued fully registered as to both interest and principal. The transfer agent now sends interest payments to owners of record on the interest  Payable Date .  Book Entry  bonds are still fully registered, but there is no physical certificate and the transfer agent keeps track of ownership. U.S. Government  Negotiable  securities (i.e.,  Treasury Bills, Notes  and  Bonds ) are issued book entry, with no certificate. The customer’s  Confirmation  serves as proof of ownership.

**Corporate Bond**

A bond issued by a corporation. Corporations generally issue three types of bonds:  Secured Bonds ,  Unsecured Bond s (Debentures), and  Subordinated Debentures. 

All corporate bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer, but a secured bond is further backed by specific assets that act as collateral for the bond.

In contrast, unsecured bonds are backed by the general assets of the corporation only. There are three basic types of Secured Bonds:

 Mortgage Bonds  are secured by real estate owned by the issuer

 Equipment Trust Certificates  are secured by equipment owned and used in the issuers business

 Collateral Trust  Bonds are secured by a portfolio of non-issuer securities. (Usually U.S. Government securities)

Secured Bonds are considered to be Senior Debt Securities, and have a senior creditor status; they are the first to be paid principal or interest and are thus the safest of an issuer’s securities. Unsecured Bonds include debentures and subordinated debentures. Debentures have a general creditor status and will be paid only after all secured creditors have been satisfied. Subordinated debentures have a subordinate creditor status and will be paid after all senior and general creditors have first been satisfied.

**Treasury Securities**

Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are marketable securities the U.S. government sells in order to pay off maturing debt and raise the cash needed to run the federal government. When an investor buys one of these securities, he/she is lending money to the U.S. government.

**Treasury bills** are short-term obligations issued for one year or less. They are sold at a discount from face value and don't pay interest before maturity. The interest is the difference between the purchase price of the bill and the amount that is paid to the investor at maturity (face value) or at the time of sale prior to maturity.

**Treasury notes** and bonds bear a stated interest rate, and the owner receives semi-annual interest payments. Treasury notes have a term of more than one year, but not more than 10 years.

**Treasury bonds** are issued by the U.S. Government. These are considered safe investments because they are backed by the taxing authority of the U.S. government, and the interest on Treasury bonds is not subject to state income tax. T-bonds have maturities greater than ten years, while notes and bills have lower maturities. Individually, they sometimes are called "T-bills," "T-notes," and "T-bonds." They can be bought and sold in the secondary market at prevailing market prices.

**Savings Bonds** are bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury, but they aren't are not marketable and the owner of a Savings Bond cannot transfer his security to someone else.

**Equity**

Equity (Stock) is a security, representing an ownership interest. Equity refers to the value of the funds contributed by the owners (the stockholders) plus the retained earnings (or losses).

**Common Stock**

Common stock represents an ownership interest in a company. Owners of stock also have  Limited Liability  (i.e.) the maximum a shareholder can lose is their original investment. Most of the stock traded in the markets today is common. An individual with a majority shareholding or controlling interest controls a company's decisions and can appoint anyone he/she wishes to the board of directors or to the management team.

Corporations seeking capital sell it to investors through a  Primary Offering  or an  Initial Public Offering (IPO).  Before shares can be offered, or sold to the general public, they must first be registered with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . Once the shares have been sold to investors, the shareholders are usually free to sell or trade their stock shares in the  Secondary Markets  (such as the New York Stock Exchange –  NYSE ). From time to time, the Issuer may choose to repurchase the stock they previously issued. Such repurchased stock shares are referred to as  Treasury Stock,  and the shares that remain trading in the secondary market are referred to as  Shares Outstanding . Treasury Stock does not have voting rights and is not entitled to any declared dividends. Corporations may use Treasury Stock to pay a stock dividend, to offer to employees.

**Stock Terminology:**

 Public Offering Price  ( POP ) – The price at which shares are offered to the public in a  Primary Offering . This price is fixed and must be maintained when  Underwriters  sell to customers.

 Current Market Price  – The price determined by Supply and Demand in the Secondary Markets.

 Book Value –  The theoretical liquidation value of a stock based on the company's  Balance Sheet. 

 Par Value  – An arbitrary price used to account for the shares in the firm’s balance sheet. This value is meaningless for common shareholders, but is important to owners of  Preferred Stock .

**Warrants**

Warrants are call options – variants of equity. They are usually offered as bonus or sweetener, attached to another security and sold as a  Unit . For example, a company is planning to issue bonds, but the market dictates a 9% interest payment. The issuer does not want to pay 9%, so they “sweeten” the bonds by adding warrants that give the holder the right to buy the issuers stock at a given price over a given period of time. Warrants can be traded, exercised, or expire worthless.

**Derivatives**

A derivative is a product whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, index or reference rate. The underlying asset can be equity, foreign exchange, commodity or any other item. For example, if the settlement price of a derivative is based on the stock price, which changes on a daily basis, then the derivative risks are also changing on a daily basis. Hence derivative risks and positions must be monitored constantly.

**Swaps**

Swaps are the exchange of cash flows or one security for another to change the maturity (bonds) or quality of issues (stocks or bonds), or because investment objectives have changed. For example, one firm may have a lower fixed interest rate, while another has access to a lower floating interest rate. These firms could swap to take advantage of the lower rates.

**Currency Swap** involves the exchange of principal and interest in one currency for the same in another currency.

**Forward Swap** agreements are created through the synthesis of two different swaps, differing in duration, for the purpose of fulfilling the specific timeframe needs of an investor. Sometimes swaps don't perfectly match the needs of investors wishing to hedge certain risks. For example, if an investor wants to hedge for a five-year duration beginning one year from today, they can enter into both a one-year and six-year swap, creating the forward swap that meets the requirements for their portfolio.

**Swaptions -** An option to enter into an interest rate swap. The contract gives the buyer the option to execute an interest rate swap on a future date, thereby locking in financing costs at a specified fixed rate of interest. The seller of the swaption, usually a commercial or investment bank, assumes the risk of interest rate changes, in exchange for payment of a swap premium.

**Type of Financial Markets:**

**Primary Markets**

Primary market is one where new financial instruments are issued for the first time. They provide a standard institutionalized process to raise money. The public offerings are done through a prospectus. A prospectus is a document that gives detailed information about the company, their prospective plans, potential risks associated with the business plans and the financial instrument.

**Secondary Markets**

Secondary Market is a place where primary market instruments, once issued, are bought and sold. An investor may wish to sell the financial asset and encash the investment after some time or the investor may wish to invest more, buy more of the same asset instead, the decision influenced by a variety of possible reasons. They provide the investor with an easy way to buy or sell.

**Different financial Markets:**

A financial market is known by the type of financial asset or instrument traded in it. So there are as many types of financial markets as there are of instruments. Typical examples of financial markets are:

**Stock market**

Stock markets are the best known among all financial markets because of large participation of the “retail investors”. E.g. NYSE, NASDAQ

**Bond** **market**

As the name suggests, bonds are issued and traded in these markets. Government bonds constitute the bulk of the bonds issued and traded in these markets. Bond markets are also sometimes called Fixed Income markets. While some of the bonds are traded in exchanges, most of the bond trading is conducted over-the-counter (OTC), i.e. by direct negotiations between dealers. Lately there have been efforts to create computer-based market place for certain type of bonds.

**Money market**

Money market is for short term financial instruments, usually a day to less than a year. The most common instrument is a “repo”, short for repurchase agreement. A repo is a contract in which the seller of securities, such as Treasury Bills, agrees to buy them back at a specified time and price. Treasury bills of very short tenure, commercial paper, certificates of deposits etc. are also considered as money market instruments.

**Foreign exchange** (Forex or FX for short) market (also called the currency market).

Foreign exchange markets are where the foreign currencies are bought and sold. For example, importers need foreign currency to pay for their imports. Government needs foreign currency to pay for its imports such as defense equipment and to repay loans taken in foreign currency

**Financial Market Systems:**

**Trading Systems**

The volume of transactions in capital markets demands advanced systems to ensure speed and reliability. Due to proliferation of Internet technology, the trading systems are also now accessible online allowing even more participants from any part of the world to transact, helping to increase efficiency and liquidity. The trading systems can be divided into front-end order entry and back-end order processing systems.

Order entry systems also offer functions such as order tracking, calculation of profit and loss based on real-time price movements and various tools to calculate and display risk to the value of investments due to price movement and other factors.

Back-office systems validate orders, route them to the exchange(s), receive messages and notifications from the exchanges, interface with external agencies such as clearing firm, generate management, investor and compliance reports, keep track of member account balances etc.

**Exchange Systems**

The core exchange system is the trading platform that accepts orders from members, displays the price quotes and trades, matches buy and sell orders dynamically to fill as many orders as possible and sends status messages and trade notifications to the parties involved in each trade. In addition, exchanges need systems to monitor the transactions, generate reports on transactions, keep track of member accounts, etc.

**Portfolio Management Systems**

These systems allow the investment managers to choose the instruments to invest in, based on the requirements or inputs such as amount to be invested, expected returns, duration (or tenure) of investment, risk tolerance etc. and analysis of price and other data on the instruments and issuers. The term “portfolio” refers to the basket of investments owned by an investor. A portfolio of investments allows one to diversify risks over a limited number of instruments and issuers.

**Accounting Systems**

The accounting systems take care of present value calculations, profit & loss etc. - of investments and funds and not the financial accounts of the firms.

**Financial Accounting**

Why do we need Accounting and Financial Statements? For the below main reasons:

**1.** The **managers** of the business will want to know how things are going. They need financial information in order to **plan** for the future; they need more up-to-date information in order to check whether actual performance is on target. So accounting is the first step in what we call management **accounting**.

**2.** There are several other groups of people who may have an interest in the finances of the business (often referred to as '**stakeholders**'). The law says that they have a legal right to certain information. The whole process of providing this information (and of maintaining a book-keeping system which is capable of providing it) is known as **financial accounting.**

The stakeholders of any firm could be any or all of the following:

1. Shareholders

2. Employees

3. Management

4. Customers

5. Government

6. Trade Unions and others

**Balance Sheet**

A Balance sheet is a statement that lists the total assets and the total liabilities of a given business to portray its net worth at a **given moment of time**. Thus, if we look at any balance sheet, it is “**As on March 31st 200X**” (Or whatever the financial year ending date)

So, it indicates the health of the firm at a point of time.

**What are the individual items in a Balance Sheet?**

First of all it’s called a balance sheet because the Asset and Liabilities in a Balance sheet balance, meaning they equal each other – it’s as simple as that!

An **Asset** is anything owned by an individual or a business, which has commercial value. Claims against others also qualify as Assets. (That is, if someone owes us something, then it is also an asset, as it actually belongs to us and is of commercial value)

A **Liability** is a debt payable by the firm to its creditors. It represents an economic obligation to pay cash, or provide goods and services, in some future period. (Thus, if we buy a bike on installments, Bike is of course an asset as it has capability to provide us service for next few years, but the loan amount which we need to pay out in installments is a Liability we incur.)

**Assets**:

**Current Assets**

Current Assets are those assets of a company that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash, or sold, or consumed in the next one year. Some current assets are listed below:

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Cash And Cash Equivalents means all cash, securities, which can be converted into cash at a very short notice, and other near-cash items (E.g. checks, drafts, cash in bank accounts etc).

**Short Term Investments**: All investments, which will be converted in Cash in the next one year. All the assets (bonds etc) with less than one year “time to maturity” will be accounted under this item (E.g. short term securities).

**Receivables**: Also referred to as Account receivables. This indicates the money due to the firm, for service rendered or goods sold on credit.

**Inventory**: Inventory for companies includes raw materials, items available for sale or in the process of being made ready for sale (work in process). For a stockbroker, it will be the securities bought and held by him, for resale.

**Other Current Assets**: Anything else which could not be categorized in one of the items above but we know that it’s a current asset can be accounted for here.

### LONG-TERM ASSETS

Long-term assets are those assets that are not consumed during the normal course of business, e.g. land, buildings and equipment, goodwill, etc. They include:

**Fixed Assets**: Fixed Assets are assets of a permanent nature required for the normal conduct of a business, and which will not normally be converted into cash during the next fiscal period. For example, furniture, fixtures, land, and buildings are all fixed assets. Fixed asset is value of all property, plant, and equipment, net of depreciation.

**Depreciation**

We all understand that if we buy a car today, after 5 years of service the value of the car would not be same. We will not be able to sell the car after 5 years at the same price at which we bought the car. This means that assets lose their value as they provide service. This loss of value, or spreading of cost, is called depreciation.

### Liabilities

**Current Liabilities**

Current Liabilities are amounts, or goods and services, to be paid or executed, within next one year.

**Payables and Accrued Expenses**: A Company might have suppliers who supply on credit, and this is an **Account Payable**. An accrued expense is an expense that the company has already incurred but company has not paid for it so far.

**Short Term Loans**: All the loans that have to be paid in the next one year.

**Debt payments due in the next year**: Loans of 10-15 years duration are sometimes repaid in installments every year, and so just the money that has to be paid in the next one year would be accounted here.

**Other Current Liabilities**: Any liabilities, which cannot be categorized under any of the headings above.

### LONG-TERM LIABILITIES

**Long-term debt**: All debt, including bonds, debentures, bank debt, mortgages, deferred portions of long-term debt, and capital lease obligations. Please note that part of the loan that is due only after next one year is indicated here.

**Deferred Liabilities/Provisions**: Deferred, in accounting, is any item where the asset or liability is not realized until a future date, e.g. annuities, charges, taxes, income, etc. So in this case, one knows that there will be some expenses, but the exact amount and dates are not known.

**Other Liabilities**: Any liabilities, which cannot be categorized under any of the headings above.

**Equity** This is basically equity share capital, which is capital raised by an entity through the sale of common shares in the primary market. This is also called share capital.

**Retained Earnings**

Retained Earnings are profits of the business that have not been distributed to the owners as of the balance sheet date. The earnings have been "retained" for planned activities such as business expansion - so they actually belong to the owners (shareholders), but have been retained.

## Income (P & L) Statements

**Profit And Loss Statement (P&L)** is also known as an income statement. It shows business revenue and expenses for a **specific** period of time (such as the financial year – so if we look at any P & L statement, it always specifies a period of time, as: For the Financial Year Ended 31st December 2003. The difference between the total revenue and the total expense is the business’ net income.

A key element of this statement, and one that distinguishes it from a balance sheet, is that the amounts shown on this statement represent transactions over a period of time while the items represented on the balance sheet show information as of a specific date (or point in time). So in engineering terms, Balance sheet has a memory like Flip-flops, while Income statement doesn’t have a memory.

It is important to understand that for a company “Profit” need not equal the “Cash” it has generated during a period. It might so happen that company has provided the service but the client has not yet paid and so company makes a Profit but not Cash. To account for cash generated during a period, companies also report “Cash flow statement”.
